# Floria Leger - Interactive Portfolio

**Live Demo: [https://florialger.netlify.app/](https://florialger.netlify.app/)**

## üéØ About

This is a personal interactive portfolio designed to merge technical skills (React, Node.js) and artistic abilities (drawing, UX/UI design). It serves to highlight my hybrid profile and experiment with web animations, primarily aimed at supporting my search for a UX/UI apprenticeship.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, Framer Motion, CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Netlify Functions
*   **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
*   **Hosting:** Netlify

## üöÄ Local Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/florialeger/portfolio.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd portfolio--
    ```
3.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Install Netlify CLI globally** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install netlify-cli -g
    ```
    *(This is required to run the local development environment that includes Netlify Functions.)*

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    netlify dev
    ```
    *(This command starts the Vite development server for the frontend and emulates Netlify Functions for the backend.)*

The application should now be running locally, typically at `http://localhost:8888`.
